# Datastructures
A course project for TIE-20100 Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit (Datastructures and algorithms), spring 2019

Goal of the project was to implement a "backend" for a graphical graph drawing program. Everything was done using only C++17 standard library. Making the most out of the STL, seeking the fastest possible implementations, implementing route finding algorithms and evaluating complexity were part of the project also. Files with the actual work moved here from university's internal GitLab, with short descriptions for the both parts of the project, in Finnish (pdf files).
